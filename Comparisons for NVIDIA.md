Naive:
In the provided conversation, there is no explicit mention of Lee Kuan Yew (referred to as "Mr. Lee" in the transcript) directly stating that someone will turn 92. However, the context strongly implies that Mr. Lee was referring to his wife or partner.

The dialogue reveals that Mr. Lee’s wife has been bedridden for nearly two years due to a series of strokes. He mentions her age multiple times and refers to her as "she," indicating she is approximately 89 years old at the time of their conversation (since she is about 2.5 years older than him, who was then around 86). Given that Mr. Lee’s wife has been ill for some time, it is reasonable to infer that he is discussing her health and future with the interviewer.

The conversation also includes a poignant moment where Mr. Lee reflects on his wife's age and their shared history:

> "She's two-and-a-half years older than me, so she's coming on to 90."

This statement directly indicates that they are in their late eighties, making it clear that the 'her' who turns 92 is likely Mr. Lee’s wife.

In summary, while the exact age of 92 isn't mentioned, the context strongly suggests that "her" refers to Mr. Lee's wife, who has been ill for nearly two years and is nearing her nineties.

Hybrid:
Based on the context provided, Mr. Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) is likely referring to his wife when he mentions someone turning 92. In one of the conversations, he states, "She’s two-and-a-half years older than me, so she's coming on to 90." Given that a few years have passed since this statement, and considering Mr. Lee himself was around 87 at the time, it is reasonable to infer that his wife has turned 92 by then.

This mention of his wife’s age underscores the closeness and shared experiences within their relationship, highlighting how significant her presence continues to be in his life despite their advanced ages.
