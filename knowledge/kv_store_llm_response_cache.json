Among them, Ng Kok Song, the Chief Investment Officer of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, played a pivotal role. Ng introduced Lee Kuan Yew to the practice of meditation, which became an important aspect of his life as he sought to reflect on and cope with the stresses of governance and personal challenges.\n\nFurthermore, Laurence Freeman, a Catholic meditation teacher, was another influential figure who imparted teachings on meditation that resonated with Lee Kuan Yew. Freeman's approach to meditation helped shape Lee's understanding of the practice, establishing a deeper connection to spiritual reflection.\n\nBoth of these mentors contributed to Lee Kuan Yew's journey into meditation, allowing him to cultivate a sense of serenity and introspection amidst the complexities he faced in public life.",
