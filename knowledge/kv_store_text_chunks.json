    "content": "TRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER MENTOR LEE KUAN YEW’S INTERVIEW WITH\nSETH MYDANS OF NEW YORK TIMES & IHT ON 1 SEPTEMBER 2010.\nMr Lee: “Thank you. When you are coming to 87, you are not very happy..”\nQ: “Not. Well you should be glad that you‟ve gotten way past where most of us\nwill get.”\nMr Lee: “That is my trouble. So, when is the last leaf falling?”\nQ: “Do you feel like that, do you feel like the leaves are coming off?”\nMr Lee: “Well, yes. I mean I can feel the gradual decline of energy and vitality\nand I mean generally every year when you know you are not on the same level\nas last year. But that is life.”\nQ: “My mother used to say never get old.”\nMr Lee: “Well, there you will try never to think yourself old. I mean I keep fit, I\nswim, I cycle.”\nQ: “And yoga, is that right? Meditation?”\nMr Lee: “Yes.”\nQ: “Tell me about meditation?”\nMr Lee: “Well, I started it about two, three years ago when Ng Kok Song, the\nChief Investment Officer of the Government of Singapore Investment\nCorporation, I knew he was doing meditation. His wife had died but he was\ncompletely serene. So, I said, how do you achieve this? He said I meditate\neveryday and so did my wife and when she was dying of cancer, she was totally\n1\nserene because she meditated everyday and he gave me a video of her in her\nlast few weeks completely composed completely relaxed and she and him had\nbeen meditating for years. Well, I said to him, you teach me. He is a devout\nChristian. He was taught by a man called Laurence Freeman, a Catholic. His\nguru was John Main a devout Catholic. When I was in London, Ng Kok Song\nintroduced me to Laurence Freeman. In fact, he is coming on Saturday to visit\nSingapore, and we will do a meditation session. The problem is to keep the\nmonkey mind from running off into all kinds of thoughts. It is most difficult to stay\nfocused on the mantra. The discipline is to have a mantra which you keep\nrepeating in your innermost heart, no need to voice it over and over again\nthroughout the whole period of meditation. The mantra they recommended was\na religious one. Ma Ra Na Ta, four syllables. Come To Me Oh Lord Jesus. So I\nsaid Okay, I am not a Catholic but I will try. He said you can take any other\nmantra, Buddhist Om Mi Tuo Fo, and keep repeating it. To me Ma Ran Na Ta is\nmore soothing. So I used Ma Ra Na Ta. You must be disciplined. I find it helps\nme go to sleep after that. A certain tranquility settles over you. The day‟s\npressures and worries are pushed out. Then there‟s less problem sleeping. I\nmiss it sometimes when I am tired, or have gone out to a dinner and had wine.\nThen I cannot concentrate. Otherwise I stick to it.”\nQ: “So...”\nMr Lee: “.. for a good meditator will do it for half-an-hour. I do it for 20 minutes.\n”\nQ: “So, would you say like your friend who taught you, would you say you are\nserene?”\nMr Lee: “Well, not as serene as he is. He has done it for many years and he is a\ndevout Catholic. That makes a difference. He believes in Jesus. He believes in\nthe teachings of the Bible. He has lost his wife, a great calamity. But the wife\nwas serene. He gave me this video to show how meditation helped her in her\n2\nlast few months. I do not think I can achieve his level of serenity. But I do\nachieve some composure.”\nQ: “And do you find that at this time in your life you do find yourself getting closer\nto religion of one sort or another?”\nMr Lee: “I am an agnostic. I was brought up in a traditional Chinese family with\nancestor worship. I would go to my grandfather‟s grave on All Soul‟s Day which\nis called “Qingming”\n. My father would bring me along, lay out food and candles\nand burn some paper money and kowtow three times over his tombstone. At\nhome on specific days outside the kitchen he would put up two candles with my\ngrandfather‟s picture. But as I grew up, I questioned this because I think this is\nsuperstition. You are gone, you burn paper money, how can he collect the paper\nmoney where he is? After my father died, I dropped the practice. My youngest\nbrother baptised my father as a Christian. He did not have the right to. He was a\ndoctor and for the last weeks before my father‟s life, he took my father to his\nhouse because he was a doctor and was able to keep my father comforted. I do\nnot know if my father was fully aware when he was converted into Christianity.”\nQ: “Converted your father?”\nMr Lee: “Yes.\n”\nQ: “Well this happens when you get close to the end.”\nMr Lee: “Well, but I do not know whether my father agreed. At that time he may\nhave been beyond making a rational decision. My brother assumed that he\nagreed and converted him.”\nQ: “But…”\n3\nMr Lee: “I am not converted.”\nQ: next?”\n“But when you reach that stage,",

My brother assumed that he\nagreed and converted him.”\nQ: “But…”\n3\nMr Lee: “I am not converted.”\nQ: next?”\n“But when you reach that stage, you may wonder more than ever what is\nMr Lee: “Well, what is next, I do not know. Nobody has ever come back. The\nMuslims say that there are seventy houris, beautiful women up there. But\nnobody has come back to confirm this.”\nQ: “And you haven‟t converted to Islam, knowing that?”\nMr Lee: “Most unlikely. The Buddhist believes in transmigration of the soul. If\nyou live a good life, the reward is in your next migration, you will be a good being,\nnot an ugly animal. It is a comforting thought, but my wife and I do not believe in\nit. She has been for two years bed-ridden, unable to speak after a series of\nstrokes. I am not going to convert her. I am not going to allow anybody to\nconvert her because I know it will be against what she believed in all her life.\nHow do I comfort myself? Well, I say life is just like that. You can‟t choose how\nyou go unless you are going to take an overdose of sleeping pills, like sodium\namytal. For just over two years, she has been inert in bed, but still cognitive.\nShe understands when I talk to her, which I do every night. She keeps awake for\nme; I tell her about my day‟s work, read her favourite poems.”\nQ: „And what kind of books do you read to her?”\nMr Lee: “So much of my time is reading things online. The latest book which I\nwant to read or re-read is Kim. It is a beautiful of description of India as it was in\nKipling‟s time. And he had an insight into the Indian mind and it is still basically\nthat same society that I find when I visit India. “\n4\nQ: “When you spoke to Time Magazine a couple of years ago, you said Don\nQuixote was your favourite?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, I was just given the book, Don Quixote, a new translation.\n”\nQ: “But people might find that ironic because he was fantasist who did not\nrealistically choose his projects and you are sort of the opposite?”\nMr Lee: “No, no, you must have something fanciful and a flight of fancy. I had a\ncolleague Rajaratnam who read Sci-Fi for his leisure.”‟\nQ: “And you?”:\nMr Lee: “No, I do not believe in Sci-Fi.”\nQ: “But you must have something to fantasise.”\nMr Lee: “Well, at the moment, as I said, I would like to read Kim again. Why I\nthought of Kim was because I have just been through a list of audio books to\nchoose for my wife. Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, books she has on her book shelf.\nSo, I ticked off the ones I think she would find interesting. The one that caught\nmy eye was Kim. She was into literature, from Alice in Wonderland, to\nAdventures with a Looking Glass, to Jane Austen‟s Persuasion, Pride and\nPrejudice, and Sense and Sensibility. Jane Austen was her favourite writer\nbecause she wrote elegant and leisurely English prose of the 19th century. The\nprose flowed beautifully, described the human condition in a graceful way, and\nrolls off the tongue and in the mind. She enjoyed it. Also Chaucer‟s Canterbury\nTales. She was an English Literature major.”\nQ: “You are naming books on the list, not necessarily books you have already\nread, yes?”\n5\nMr Lee: “I would have read some of them.”\nQ: “Like a Jane Austen book, or Canterbury Tales?”\nMr Lee: “No, Canterbury Tales, I had to do it for my second year English\nLiterature course in Raffles College. For a person in the 15th Century, he wrote\nvery modern stuff. I didn‟t find his English all that archaic. I find those Scottish\npoets difficult to read. Sometimes I don‟t make sense of their Scottish brogue.\nMy wife makes sense of them. Then Shakespeare‟s sonnets.”\nQ: “You read those?”\nMr Lee: “I read those sonnets when I did English literature in my freshman‟s\nyear. She read them.”\nQ: “When you say she reads them now, you‟re the one who reads them, yes?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, I read them to her.”\nQ: “But you go to her.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, I read from an Anthology of Poems which she has, and several\nother anthologies. So I know her favourite poems. She had flagged them. I read\nthem to her.”\nQ: “She‟s in the hospital? You go to the hospital?”\nMr Lee: “No, no, she‟s at home. We‟ve got a hospital bed and nurses attending\nto her. We used to share the same room. Now I‟m staying in the next room.

Now I‟m staying in the next room. I\nhave to get used to her groans and grunts when she‟s uncomfortable from a dry\n6\nthroat and they pump in a spray moisture called “Biothene” which soothes her\nthroat, and they suck out phlegm. Because she can‟t get up, she can‟t breathe\nfully. The phlegm accumulates in the chest but you can‟t suck it out from the\nchest, you‟ve got to wait until she coughs and it goes out to her throat. They\nsuck it out, and she‟s relieved. They sit her up and tap her back. It‟s very\ndistressing, but that‟s life.”\nQ: “Yes, your daughter on Sunday wrote a moving column, movingly about the\nsituation referring to you.”\nMr Lee: “How did you come to read it?”\nQ: “Somebody said you‟ve got to read that column, so I read it.”\nMr Lee: “You don‟t get the Straits Times.”\nQ: “I get it online actually. I certainly do, I follow Singapore online and she wrote\nthat the whole family suffers of course from this and she wrote the one who‟s\nbeen hurting the most and is yet carrying on stoically is my father.”\nMr Lee: “What to do? What else can I do? I can‟t break down. Life has got to\ngo on. I try to busy myself, but from time to time in idle moments, my mind goes\nback to the happy days we were up and about together.”\nQ: “When you go to visit her, is that the time when your mind goes back?”\nMr Lee: “No, not then. My daughter‟s fished out many old photographs for this\npiece she wrote and picked out a dozen or two dozen photographs from the\ndigital copies which somebody had kept at the Singapore Press Holdings. When\nI look at them, I thought how lucky I was. I had 61 years of happiness. We‟ve\ngot to go sometime, so I‟m not sure who‟s going first, whether she or me. So I\n7\ntold her, I‟ve been looking at the marriage vows of the Christians. The best I read\nwas,” To love, to hold and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for better or for\nworse, till death do us part.” I told her I would try and keep you company for as\nlong as I can. She understood.”\nQ: “Yes, it‟s been really.”\nMr Lee: “What to do? What can you do in this situation? I can say get rid of the\nnurses. Then the maids won‟t know how to turn her over and then she gets\npneumonia. That ends the suffering. But human beings being what we are, I do\nthe best for her and the best is to give her a competent nurse who moves her,\nmassages her, turns her over, so no bed sores. I‟ve got a hospital bed with air\ncushions so no bed sores. Well, that‟s life. Make her comfortable.”\nQ: “And for yourself, you feel the weight of age more than you have in the past?”\nMr Lee: “I‟m not sure. I marginally must have. It‟s stress. However, I look at it, I\nmean, it‟s stress. That‟s life. But it‟s a different kind of stress from the kind of\nstress I faced, political stresses. Dire situations for Singapore, dire situations for\nmyself when we broke off from Malaysia, the Malays in Singapore could have\nrioted and gone for me and they suddenly found themselves back as a minority\nbecause the Tunku kicked us out. That‟s different, that‟s intense stress and it‟s\nover but this is stress which goes on. One doctor told me, you may think that\nwhen she‟s gone you‟re relieved but you‟ll be sad when she‟s gone because\nthere‟s still the human being here, there‟s still somebody you talk to and she\nknows what you‟re saying and you‟ll miss that. Well, I don‟t know, I haven‟t come\nto that but I think I‟ll probably will because it‟s now two years, May, June, July,\nAugust, September, two years and four months. It‟s become a part of my life.”\nQ: “She‟s how old now?”\n8\nMr Lee: “She‟s two-and-a-half years older than me, so she‟s coming on to 90.”\nQ: “But you did make a reference in an interview with Time magazine to\nsomething that goes beyond reason as you put it. You referred to the real enemy\nby Pierre D‟Harcourt who talked about people surviving the Nazi, it‟s better that\nthey have something to believe in.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course.”\nQ: “And you said that the Communists and the deeply religious fought on and\nsurvived. There are some things in the human spirit that are beyond reason.”\nMr Lee: “I believe that to be true. Look, I saw my friend and cabinet colleague\nwho‟s a deeply religious Catholic.

He was Finance Minister, a fine man. In 1983,\nhe had a heart attack. He was in hospital, in ICU, he improved and was taken\nout of ICU. Then he had a second heart attack and I knew it was bad. I went to\nsee him and the priest was giving him the last rites as a Catholic. Absolutely\nfearless, he showed no distress, no fear, the family was around him, his wife and\ndaughters, he had four daughters. With priest delivering the last rites, he knew\nhe was reaching the end. But his mind was clear but absolutely calm.”\nQ: “Well, I am more like you. We don‟t have something to cling to.”\nMr Lee: “That‟s our problem.”\nQ: “But also the way people see you is supremely reasonable person, reason is\nthe ultimate.”\nMr Lee: “Well, that‟s the way I‟ve been working.”\n9\nQ: “Well, you did mention to Tom Plate, they think they know me but they only\nknow the public me?”\nMr Lee: “Yeah, the private view is you have emotions for your close members of\nyour family. We are a close family, not just my sons and my wife and my parents\nbut my brothers and my sister. So my youngest brother, a doctor as I told you,\nhe just sent me an email that my second brother was dying of a bleeding colon,\ndiverticulitis. And later the third brother now has got prostate cancer and has\nspread into his lymph nodes. So I asked what‟re the chances of survival. It‟s not\ngotten to the bones yet, so they‟re doing chemotherapy and if you can prevent it\nfrom going into the bones, he‟ll be okay for a few more years. If it does get to the\nbones, then that‟s the end. I don‟t think my brother knows. But I‟ll probably go\nand see him.”\nQ: “But you yourself have been fit. You have a stent, you had heart problem late\nlast year but besides that do you have ailments?”\nMr Lee: “Well, aches and pains of a geriatric person, joints, muscles but all non-\nterminal. I go in for a physiotherapy, maintenance once a week, they give me a\nrub over because when I cycle, my thighs get sore, knees get a little painful, and\nso the hips.”\nQ: “These are the signs of age.”\nMr Lee: “Yeah, of course.”\nQ: “I‟m 64. I‟m beginning to feel that and I don‟t like it and I don‟t want to admit to\nmyself.”\nMr Lee: “But if you stop exercising, you make it worse. That‟s what my doctors\ntell me, just carry on. When you have these aches and pains, we‟ll give you\n10\nphysiotherapy. I‟ve learnt to use heat pads at home. So after the physiotherapy,\nonce a week, if I feel my thighs are sore, I just have a heat pad there. You put in\nthe microwave oven and you tie it around your thighs or your ankles or your\ncalves. It relieves the pain.”\nQ: “So you continue to cycle.”\nMr Lee: “Oh yeah.”\nQ: “Treadmill?”\nMr Lee: “No, I don‟t do the treadmill. I walk but not always. When I‟ve cycled\nenough I don‟t walk.”\nQ: “That‟s your primary exercise, swimming?”\nMr Lee: “Yeah, I swim everyday, it‟s relaxing.”\nQ: “What other secrets, I see you drink hot water?”\nMr Lee: “Yes.”\nQ: “Tell me about it.”\nMr Lee: “Well, I used to drink tea but tea is a diuretic, but I didn‟t know that. I\nused to drink litres of it. In the 1980s, I was having a conference with Zhou\nZiyang who was then Secretary-General of the Communist Party in the Great\nHall of the People. The Chinese came in and poured more tea and hot water. I\nwas scoffing it down because it kept my throat moistened, my BP was up\nbecause more liquid was in me. Halfway through, I said please stop. I‟m dashing\noff. I had to relief myself. Then my doctors said don‟t you know that tea is a\n11\ndiuretic? I don‟t like coffee, it gives me a sour stomach, so okay, let‟s switch to\nwater.”\nQ: “You know you had the hot water when I met you a couple of years ago and\nafter I told my wife about that, she switched to hot water. She‟s not sure why\nexcept that you drink hot water, so she‟s decided to.”\nMr Lee: “Well, cold water, this was from my ENT man. If you drink cold water,\nyou reduce the temperature of your nasal passages and throat and reduce your\nresistance to coughs and colds. So I take warm water, body temperature. I don‟t\nscald myself with boiling hot water. I avoid that. But my daughter puts blocks of\nice into her coffee and drinks it up. She‟s all right",

I don‟t\nscald myself with boiling hot water. I avoid that. But my daughter puts blocks of\nice into her coffee and drinks it up. She‟s all right, she‟s only 50-plus.”\nQ: “Let me ask a question about the outside world a little bit. Singapore is a\ngreat success story even though people criticize this and that. When you look\nback, you can be proud of what you‟ve done and I assume you are. Are there\nthings that you regret, things that you wished you could achieve that you\ncouldn‟t?”\nMr Lee: “Well, first I regret having been turfed out of Malaysia. I think if the\nTunku had kept us together, what we did in Singapore, had Malaysia accepted a\nmultiracial base for their society, much of what we‟ve achieved in Singapore\nwould be achieved in Malaysia. But not as much because it‟s a much broader\nbase. We would have improved inter-racial relations and an improved holistic\nsituation. Now we have a very polarized Malaysia, Malays, Chinese and Indians\nin separate schools, living separate lives and not really getting on with one\nanother. You read them. That‟s bad for us as close neighbours.”\nQ: “So at that time, you found yourself with Singapore and you have transformed\nit. And my question would be how do you assess your own satisfaction with what\nyou‟ve achieved? What didn‟t work?”\n12\nMr Lee: “Well, the greatest satisfaction I had was my colleagues and I, were of\nthat generation who were turfed out of Malaysia suffered two years under a racial\npolicy decided that we will go the other way. We will not as a majority squeeze\nthe minority because once we‟re by ourselves, the Chinese become the majority.\nWe made quite sure whatever your race, language or religion, you are an equal\ncitizen and we‟ll drum that into the people and I think our Chinese understand\nand today we have an integrated society. Our Malays are English-educated,\nthey‟re no longer like the Malays in Malaysia and you can see there are some still\nwearing headscarves but very modern looking.”\nQ: “That doesn‟t sound like a regret to me.”\nMr Lee: “No, no, but the regret is there‟s such a narrow base to build this\nenormous edifice, so I‟ve got to tell the next generation, please do not take for\ngranted what‟s been built. If you forget that this is a small island which we are\nbuilt upon and reach a 100 storeys high tower block and may go up to 150 if you\nare wise. But if you believe that it‟s permanent, it will come tumbling down and\nyou will never get a second chance.”\nQ: “I wonder if that is a concern of yours about the next generation. I saw your\ndiscussion with a group of young people before the last election and they were\nsaying what they want is a lot of these values from the West, an open political\nmarketplace and even playing field in all of these things and you said well, if\nthat‟s the way you feel, I‟m very sad.”\nMr Lee: “Because you play it that way, if you have dissension, if you chose the\neasy way to Muslim votes and switch to racial politics, this society is finished.\nThe easiest way to get majority vote is vote for me, we‟re Chinese, they‟re\nIndians, they‟re Malays. Our society will be ripped apart. If you do not have a\ncohesive society, you cannot make progress.”\n13\nQ: “But is that a concern that the younger generation doesn‟t realize as much as\nit should?”\nMr Lee: “I believe they have come to believe that this is a natural state of affairs,\nand they can take liberties with it. They think you can put it on auto-pilot. I know\nthat is never so. We have crafted a set of very intricate rules, no housing blocks\nshall have more than a percentage of so many Chinese, so many percent\nMalays, Indians. All are thoroughly mixed. Willy-nilly, your neighbours are\nIndians, Malays, you go to the same shopping malls, you go to the same schools,\nthe same playing fields, you go up and down the same lifts. We cannot allow\nsegregation.”\nQ: “There are people who think that Singapore may lighten up a little bit when\nyou go, that the rules will become a little looser and if that happens, that might be\nsomething that‟s a concern to you.”\nMr Lee: “No, you can go looser where it‟s not race, language and religion\nbecause those are deeply gut issues and it will surface the moment you start\nplaying on them. It‟s inevitable, but on other areas, policies, right or wrong,\ndisparity of opportunities, rich and poor, well go ahead. But don‟t play race,\nlanguage, religion. We‟ve got here, we‟ve become cohesive, keep it that way.\nWe‟ve not used Chinese as a majority language because it will split the\npopulation.

Catherine\nLim, “an authoritarian, no-nonsense manner that has little use for sentiment”.”\n14\nMr Lee: “She‟s a novelist, therefore, she simplifies a person‟s character, make\ngraphic caricature of me. But is anybody that simple or simplistic?”\nQ: “Sentiment though, you don‟t show that very much in public.”\nMr Lee: “Well, that‟s a Chinese ideal. A gentleman in Chinese ideal, the junzi\n(君子) is someone who is always composed and possessed of himself and\ndoesn‟t lose his temper and doesn‟t lose his tongue. That‟s what I try to do,\nexcept when I got turfed out from Malaysia. Then, I just couldn‟t help it.”\nQ: “One aspect of the way you‟ve constructed Singapore is a certain level of fear\nperhaps in the population. You described yourself as a street fighter, knuckle\nduster and so forth.”\nMr Lee: “Yes.”\nQ: “And that produces among some people a level of fear and I want to tell you\nwhat a taxi driver said when I said I was going to interview you. He said, safer\nnot to ask him anything. If you ask him, somebody will follow you. We‟re not in\npolitics so just let him do the politics.”\nMr Lee: “How old is he?‟\nQ: “I‟m sorry, middle aged, I don‟t know.”\nMr Lee: “I go out. I‟m no longer the Prime Minister. I don‟t have to do the difficult\nthings. Everybody wants to shake my hands, everybody wants me to autograph\nsomething. Everybody wants to get around me to take a photo. So it‟s a\nproblem.”\n15\nQ: “Yes but...”\nMr Lee: “Because I‟m no longer in charge, I don‟t have to do the hard things.\nI‟ve laid the foundation and they know that because of that foundation, they‟re\nenjoying this life.‟\nQ: “So when you were the one directly in-charge, you had to be tough, you had\nto be a fighter.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course. I had to fight left-wingers, Communists, pro-Communist\ngroups who had killer squads. If I didn‟t have the guts and the gumption to take\nthem on, there wouldn‟t be the Singapore. They would have taken over and it\nwould have collapsed. I also had to fight the Malay Ultras when we were in\nMalaysia for two years.”\nQ: “Well, you don‟t have a lot of dissidents in prison but you‟re known for your\nlibel suits which keeps a lot of people at bay.”\nMr Lee: “We are non-corrupt. We lead modest lives, so it‟s difficult to malign us.\nWhat‟s the easy way to get a leader down? He‟s a hypocrite, he is corrupt, he\npretends to be this when in fact he‟s that. That‟s what they‟re trying to do to me.\nWell, prove it, if what you say is right, then I don‟t deserve this reputation. Why\nmust you say these things without foundation? I‟m taking you to court, you‟ve\nmade these allegations, I‟m open to your cross-examination.”\nQ: “But that may produce what I was talking about, about a level of fear.”\nMr Lee: “No, you‟re fearful of a libel suit? Then don‟t issue these defamatory\nstatements or make them where you have no basis. The Western\ncorrespondent, especially those who hop in and hop out got to find something to\n16\nshow that they are impartial, that they‟re not just taken in by the Singapore\ngrowth story. They say we keep down the opposition, how? Libel suits.\nAbsolute rubbish. We have opponents in Parliament who have attacked us on\npolicy, no libel suits against them and even in Parliament they are privileged to\nmake defamatory allegation and cannot be sued. But they don‟t. They know it is\nnot true.”\nQ: “Let me ask a last question. Again back to Tom Plate, “I’m not serious all the\ntime. Everyone needs to have a good laugh now and then to see the funny side\nof things and to laugh at himself”.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course.”\nQ: “How about that?”\nMr Lee: “You have to be that.”\nQ: “So what makes you laugh?”\nMr Lee: “Many things, the absurdity of it, many things in life. Sometimes, I meet\nwitty people, have conversations, they make sharp remarks, I laugh.”\nQ: “And when you laugh at yourself as you said?”\nMr Lee: “That‟s very frequent. Yeah, I‟m reaching 87, trying to keep fit",

    "content": "Q: “How about that?”\nMr Lee: “You have to be that.”\nQ: “So what makes you laugh?”\nMr Lee: “Many things, the absurdity of it, many things in life. Sometimes, I meet\nwitty people, have conversations, they make sharp remarks, I laugh.”\nQ: “And when you laugh at yourself as you said?”\nMr Lee: “That‟s very frequent. Yeah, I‟m reaching 87, trying to keep fit,\npresenting a vigorous figure and it‟s an effort and is it worth the effort? I laugh at\nmyself trying to keep a bold front. It‟s become my habit. I just carry on.”\nQ: “So it‟s the whole broad picture of things that you find funny?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, life as a whole has many abnormalities, of course.”\n17\nQ: “Your public life together with your private life, what you‟ve done over things\npeople write about you and Singapore, that overall is something that you can find\nfunny?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course.”\nQ: “You made one of the few people who laugh at Singapore.”\nMr Lee: “Let me give you a Chinese proverb “do not judge a man until you‟ve\nclosed his coffin. Do not judge a man.” Close the coffin, then decide. Then you\nassess him. I may still do something foolish before the lid is closed on me.”\nQ: “So you‟re waiting for the final verdict?”\nMr Lee: “No, the final verdict will not be in the obituaries. The final verdict will be\nwhen the PhD students dig out the archives, read my old papers, assess what\nmy enemies have said, sift the evidence and seek the truth? I‟m not saying that\neverything I did was right, but everything I did was for an honourable purpose. I\nhad to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial.”\nQ: “For the greater good?”\nMr Lee: “Well, yes, because otherwise they are running around and causing\nhavoc playing on Chinese language and culture, and accusing me of destroying\nChinese education. You‟ve not been here when the Communists were running\naround. They do not believe in the democratic process. They don‟t believe in\none man, one vote. They believe in one bullet, one vote. They had killer squads.\nBut they at the same time had a united front exploiting the democratic game. It\ngave them cover. But my business, my job was to make sure that they did not\nsucceed. Sometimes you just got to lock the leaders up. They are confusing the\n18\npeople. The reality is that if you allow these people to work up animosity against\nthe government because it‟s keeping down the Chinese language, because\nwe‟ve promoted English, keeping down Chinese culture because you have\nallowed English literature, and we suppress our Chinese values and the Chinese\nlanguage, the Chinese press, well, you will break up the society. They harp on\nthese things when they know they are not true. They know that if you actually do\nin Chinese language and culture, the Chinese will riot and the society must break\nup.”\nQ: “So leadership is a constant battle?”\nMr Lee: “In a multiracial situation like this, it is. Malaysia took the different line;\nMalaysians saw it as a Malay country, all others are lodgers, “orang tumpangan”\n,\nand they the Bumiputras, sons of the soil, run the show. So the Sultans, the\nChief Justice and judges, generals, police commissioner, the whole hierarchy is\nMalay. All the big contracts for Malays. Malay is the language of the schools\nalthough it does not get them into modern knowledge. So the Chinese build and\nfind their own independent schools to teach Chinese, the Tamils create their own\nTamil schools, which do not get them jobs. It‟s a most unhappy situation.”\nMdm Yeong: “I thought that was the last question.”\nQ: “This is the last part of the last question. So your career has been a struggle\nto keep things going in the right way and you‟ve also said that the best way to\nkeep your health is to keep on working. Are you tired of it by this point? Do you\nfeel like you want to rest?”\nMr Lee: “No, I don‟t. I know if I rest I‟ll slide downhill fast. No, my whole being\nhas been stimulated by the daily challenge. If I suddenly drop it all, play golf,\nstroll around, watch the sunset, read novels, that‟s downhill. It is the daily\n19\nchallenge, social contacts, meeting people, people like you, you press me, I\nanswer, when I don‟t…. what have I got tomorrow?”\nMdm Yeong: “You have two more events coming up. One is the Radin Mas\nCommunity.”\nMr Lee: “Oh yeah. I got it.”\nMdm Yeong: “And then you have other call, courtesy call on the 3rd.”\nMr Lee: “We are social animals. Without that interaction with people, you are\nisolated. The worst punishment you can give a person is the isolation ward. You\nget hallucinations. Four walls, no books, no nothing. By way of example, Henry\nKissinger wants to speak to me. So I said okay, we‟ll speak on Sunday. What\nabout? We are meeting in Sao Paolo at a J P Morgan International Advisory\nBoard. He wants to talk to me to check certain facts on China. My mind is kept\nalive, I go to China once a",

My mind is kept\nalive, I go to China once a year at least. I meet Chinese leaders. So it‟s a\nconstant stimulus as I keep up to date. Supposing I sit back, I don‟t think about\nChina, just watch videos. I am off to Moscow, Kiev and Paris on the 15th of\nSeptember. Three days Moscow, three days Kiev, four days Paris. Moscow I\nam involved in the Skolkovo Business School which President Medvedev, when\nhe wasn‟t President started. I promised to go if he did not fix it in the winter.\nSo they fix it for September. I look at the fires, I said wow this is no good.”\nQ: “It‟s not going to be freezing if there are fires.”\nMr Lee: “No but our embassy says the skies have cleared. Kiev because the\nPresident has invited me specially and will fly me from Moscow to Kiev and then\nfly me on to Paris. Paris I am on the TOTAL Advisory Board together with Joe\nNye and a few others. They want a presentation on what are China‟s strengths\nand weaknesses. That keeps me alive. It‟s just not my impressionistic views of\n20\nChina but one that has to be backed by facts and figures. So my team works out\nthe facts and figures, and I check to see if they tally with my impressions. But it‟s\na constant stimulus to keep alive, and up-to-date. If I stop it, it‟s downhill.”\nQ: “Well, I hope you continue. Thank you very much, I really enjoyed this\ninterview.”",
